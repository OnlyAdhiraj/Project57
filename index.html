Did you hear the term addiction (Don’t groan! I know you hear it from your parents everyday but all addictions are not bad). Addiction distances and dissociates us from the world of books thereby ruining our creative faculty where we can experience a chance encounter.

And reading books is always a good addiction. You sit on a chair but you are actually sailing across rough seas, meeting fairies in fairyland or trying to breathe underwater where we can experience a chance encounter with mermaids. These are the reasons I feel that the world of books is the best place to seek refuge in...</h3>
